# cnc-nh/news

cnc-nh/news is a Next.js+React blog using MDX (Markdown Extended) files to display articles.

Images in the articles are rendered via the main website directory at [cnc.novushierosolymis.ml](https://cnc.novushierosolymis.ml) due to issues with gathering their paths with a subdir of a domain.

To run locally, clone this repo via `git clone`.

After, go into the directory where you cloned the repo and run `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to see the output.

Images will load from the repo's own `images/` directory.
