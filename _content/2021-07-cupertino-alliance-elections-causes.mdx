The upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused a major strain in relations with the State of Vishwamitra.

    Minister Gheorghe È˜tefan Marius, and His Majesty the King._

Relations with Vishwamitra were established on June 22, 2021, with the signing of a Treaty of Mutual Recognition, which was after months of diplomatic talks with Dhrubajyoti Roy.

Earlier this year, the April affair caused a temporary halt on diplomatic talks, but was resolved quickly.

In the Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, His Majesty the King originally supported the Roy-Mullins campaign. However, on July 14, Lord-President Tucker Gladden, the Marquess of Ridgeland, out of the blue, switched sides and crossed the aisle to join the then Hamilton-Bornstein ticket.

The Lord-President accused the Roy-Mullins campaign of harassment and bribery, which then the Superior Court of the Cupertino Alliance investigated, and they found no wrongdoing in the Roy-Mullins campaign, which then prompted an investigation into the connection between the Lord-President and Daniel Hamilton.

Many arguments then ensued between both campaigns over the weekend. AJ Lycon was disappointed and issued a stern letter regarding the elections (which can be read here).

After this, major changes were made, including a liaison and joint planning between both campaigns.

The King and the Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra then issued a joint statement in regards to the degraded relations (which can be read [here]()]).

Since then, the relations have been amicable once again, and both the King and Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra continue to commit to more stronger relations.
