After a long state of inactivity, a glimmer of hope is found in the Constitutional Committee, which begins its work today, drafting the first Novohierosolymian constitution. The main parts of the Constitution that will be added to the way of governance in the Kingdom are:

# A parliamentary system

# A Prime Minister assisted by a Council of Ministers

# An executive, rather than an absolute monarchy

A list of members of the Constitutional Committee was released yesterday, after a week of anonymous appointments. The members of the Committee are:

# The Most Hon. Kasangga Dhrubajyoti Roy, Marquess of Lalraja

# The Rt. Hon. Kasangga and Maharlika Lord Michal Nowacki, Earl of Krakow

# The Rt. Hon. Maharlika Lord Luke, Viscount Lincasher

# Mr. Matthew Tonna

# His Imperial Majesty Rory I, Emperor of Lurdentania

# His Imperial Majesty Alexander I, Emperor of Atiera

# His Majesty Cameron I, King of Ikonia

# His Excellency Åžtefan Marius Snagoveanu, President of the Snagovian Federation

The committee is expected to finish the Constitution by 23 Febuary, the 1-year anniversary of the Kingdom's foundation and the ascension of Jayden I to the Novohierosolymian throne.
