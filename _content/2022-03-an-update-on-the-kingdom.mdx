## 2022 Constitution ratified, coinciding with National Day celebrations

The 2022 Constitution was ratified on 23 February 2022, a month after the Constitutional Committee was convened to assist His Majesty the King in the process of writing the document. This re-introduces the following:

1. Westminster system of government
2. Council of Ministers

It also introduces the position of **Prime Minister**, which was a proposed idea in the early days of the Kingdom, but was scrapped due to the victory of the now-defunct Loyalist Party led by HM the King.

Also celebrated on that day was National Day, commemorating the secession of the Kingdom from the Republic of the Philippines and the establishment of the monarchy, including the beginning of the reign of the current King.

The King gave a speech that day, speaking on the evolution of the Kingdom and the progress it has made since its establishment. He received greetings from the Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, Dhrubajyoti Roy, who thanked HM the King for letting him become a part of the drafting of the Constitution.

## King's Day celebrated throughout the Kingdom

The birthday of His Majesty the King, known as King's Day, was celebrated with much joy. The Royal Family celebrated with a large feast at the Royal Palace, while those who are close associates of the King greeted him, notably the Marquess of Lalraja, Lord Liam Alexander, and members of the Cupertino Alliance.

An honors list was released that day, with numerous awards awarded, including the exclusive Order of the Belt of Truth, the Order of the Four Provinces, and honorifics, among others.

The title of "Baron Alexander of Simcuron" was also created for Sir Liam Alexander <span class="text-sm">KBT</span>, for his services in the Constitutional Committee.
