In addition, some parts may have been edited at the request of those involved, however those are limited to corrections._\n\nSophia Albina, Premier of Nordale and a leader of the MicroWiki for Justice movement was disgraced after strong and scathing accusations were released by former close associate and friend Brooklyn Kennedy, Prime Minister of the New Richmond Republic.\n\nIn her scathing remarks posted both in the Grand Unified Micronational and the MicroWiki for Justice server, Kennedy stated that Albina tried to frame her as a creator of a \"wildly inappropriate, foul photoshop of a family member of an extremely prominent veteran community member\" to the MicroWiki administration, and when she confronted Albina about this, she went on a very incomprehensible rant accusing Kennedy of being a pawn for the MicroWiki administration and implied that she was a pedophile. Albina later admitted to fabricating the falsehood due to a resent of the perceived \"special treatment\" that Kennedy received from the MicroWiki administration, even though she knew that Kennedy herself was banned from the wiki due to a certain distasteful incident, and acted like it was not there to suit her narrative. Kennedy then affirmed her commitment to the cause of the MicroWiki for Justice movement, but said that she \"washes off\" Albina and wishes to not be associated with her any longer.\n\nIn the MicroWiki for Justice server, Albina accused Kennedy of being a liar and manipulator, and hurled many transphobic and fatphobic slurs while Kennedy restated her position numerous times. After some time, Albina was removed from her position as an administrator of the MicroWiki for Justice server by Leon Montan, and he apologized for the events, adding Hunt Powell and Logan Ross to the administration team.\n\nAs we have said before, CNC News will continue giving updates on the MicroWiki safeguarding controversy as soon as we have them.\n","slug":"2022-02-sophia-albina-disgraced-from-microwiki"},{"title":"MicroWiki users rise to condemn unbanning of a certain controversial individual","date":"2022-02-21T16:52:00.000Z","description":"Over the past few days the MicroWiki sector has been rocked by controversy over the unbanning of disgraced micronationalist Zarel \"Zed\" Smith, former Prince of New Eiffel.

On 29 January 2022, Andrew Creed, head administrator of the MicroWiki website, announced the unbanning with this statement:\n\n> User has served his time. Absolutely do not harass this user upon their return to the wiki. Doing so will lead to an immediate ban on the wiki and Discord server.\n\nMicroWiki users were outraged at this decision from the administration, and wrote a joint memorandum condemning this action. As of writing it has amassed over 95 signatures.\n\nThe administration has continually tried to silence members who shared their dismay at the action, with Creed repeatedly ordering MicroWiki@Discord members to cease their discussion on this certain action, and even banning individuals who kept expressing their disgust. Due to these actions, the de facto leaders of the MicroWiki for Justice movement, namely Leon Montan (President of Ponderosa Hills), Sophia Albina (Premier of Nordale), Elizabeth Lewis (Leader of Shoreline), and Cameron Koehler (King of Ikonia and member of the Novohierosolymian Constitutional Committee) created their own Discord server to increase signatories and to make it the replacement for MicroWiki@Discord.\n\nKoehler then proceeded to use backdoors left open via a bot he created when he was a server administrator to ban all persons he could, with 1,996 users removed from the server and leaving only around 40 or so people with Discord roles that were too high to ban. This caused his indefinite ban from MicroWiki and members of the Grand Unified Micronational losing confidence in him as their Supreme Justice.\n\nThe controversy has also spilled into famed statistics company Statistic-Dime founded by the same Zarel Smith, where Creed and Christina Nowell resigned from their posts as members of the Board of Directors, with Liam Alexander, CEO of Statistic-Dime having both \"great shame to see these two tender their resignations\" and satisfaction \"in a sense they will not be here to disturb the peace anymore\". This resulted in the addition of Jayden I as Director.\n\nAs of writing, we at the CNC do not know when this controversy will die down, but we know that this is an unprecedented moment in the history of the MicroWiki sector and is a consequential event. We will continue giving readers of CNC News updates as soon as we have them.\n","slug":"2022-02-microwiki-users-rise-to-condemn"},{"title":"Snyder-Murray wins CA election in a landslide: Valentinus loses for a second time","date":"2022-01-25T07:44:00.000Z","description":"CNC News projects that Carson Snyder and James Murray will be the next Chair and Lieutenant Chair of the Cupertino Alliance, after the 1:30AM EST update from the Cupertino Electoral Supervisory Commission...","content":"\n![](/images/ca-election-jan-2022.png)\n\n_Jayden I is involved in this election: he is part of the Snyder-Murray campaign team._\n\nUPDATE: Final data from CESE awards 19 votes for Snyder-Murray and 7 votes for Valentinus-Neal.\n\nCNC News projects that Carson Snyder and James Murray will be the next Chair and Lieutenant Chair of the Cupertino Alliance, after the 1:30AM EST update from the Cupertino Electoral Supervisory Commission or CESE gave 17 votes to Snyder-Murray and a mere 6 votes for Valentinus-Neal.\nThis comes after a very quiet campaign season, which is mostly due to the last 2 campaign seasons, which were smeared by constant uncivil discussions among members of the Alliance.\n\nThis is also the first election under the 2021 Charter, which was passed in December.\n\nSnyder ran on a platform focusing on development: some promises their campaign made include an emphasis on development, adoptable and adaptable legislation, and expanding outreach.\n\nValentinus ran on an \"open and accessible\" platform: flipping the status quo on its head and moving back to the 2020 era-Alliance with a plan of reviving the long-dead Windhoek program, as well as focusing on essential services rather than non-sensical and unneeded ones, such as the Statistics Ministry.\n\nA pre-election poll from Statistic-Dime showed that 70% were in support of Snyder, while a measly 30% supported Valentinus.\n\nSnyder and Murray will take office at the end of this month, the final day of Tyler Mullins and Larry Martin's term.\n","slug":"2022-01-snyder-murray-wins-ca-election-in"},{"title":"A new constitution in the works","date":"2022-01-23T06:28:00.000Z","description":"After a long state of inactivity, a glimmer of hope is found in the Constitutional Committee, which begins its work today, drafting the first Novohierosolymian constitution.

Subsequently, he released a statement to the public apologizing for what he did and in doing so, resigned from all micronational offices, including that of Lord-President of the Privy Council, a position created specifically for Lord Gladden by King Jayden I. Lord Gladden was then succeeded by His Grace Lord Paolo Evangelista, the Duke of Christophus. The King is expected, however, to mandate Lord Evangelista's resignation by 5 December, which is when Lord Gladden reaches the age of 13, and is when he is expected to return to the inter-micronational community.\n\nMomentarily, after his suspension from the Cupertino Alliance, Liam Alexander reported Lord Gladden's account to Discord admins, which resulted in the subsequent disabling of Lord Gladden's account. He (referring to Lord Gladden) then released another statement, announcing his retirement from the inter-micronational community, naming the King (referring to Jayden I), currently Prime Minister in Oskonia, as his successor if he abdicates the throne of Oskonia, which we can say is still in the air, considering that Alexander basically ruined Gladden's micronational career. Lord Gladden has created a new account, but only few people have talked to Gladden via the said account.\n\nIt is still possible to see Lord Gladden never returning to micronationalism after what Alexander did to him, and with that, a personal union between Oskonia and Novus Hierosolymis.\n\nUPDATE: We spoke to Lord Gladden and he clarified the possibility of his abdication.\n","slug":"2021-08-lord-gladden-retires-from-inter"},{"title":"Cupertino Alliance elections causes degradation of Vish-NH relations","date":"2021-07-21T16:25:00.000Z","description":"The upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused...","content":"\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  ![](/images/ca-election-jul-2021.png) _The results of the Cupertino Alliance\n  July 14-17 poll._\n</div>\n\nThe upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused a major strain in relations with the State of Vishwamitra.\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  ![](/images/mrt-vish-2021.png) _The treaty of mutual recognition signed on\n  June 22, 2021 by His Majesty the Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, His Excellency\n  the Most Honorable Prime Minister Gheorghe È˜tefan Marius, and His Majesty the\n  King._\n</div>\n\nRelations with Vishwamitra were established on June 22, 2021, with the signing of a Treaty of Mutual Recognition, which was after months of diplomatic talks with Dhrubajyoti Roy.\n\nEarlier this year, the April affair caused a temporary halt on diplomatic talks, but was resolved quickly.\n\nIn the Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, His Majesty the King originally supported the Roy-Mullins campaign.
