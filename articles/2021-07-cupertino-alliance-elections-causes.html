<p>The upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused a major strain in relations with the State of Vishwamitra.</p>
<div class="text-center"><div><img class="mx-auto" src="/images/mrt-vish-2021.png"/></div><p><p><em>The treaty of mutual recognition signed on June 22, 2021 by His Majesty the
Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, His Excellency the Most Honorable Prime
Minister Gheorghe Ștefan Marius, and His Majesty the King.</em></p></p></div>
<p>Relations with Vishwamitra were established on June 22, 2021, with the signing of a Treaty of Mutual Recognition, which was after months of diplomatic talks with Dhrubajyoti Roy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the April affair caused a temporary halt on diplomatic talks, but was resolved quickly.</p>
<p>In the Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, His Majesty the King originally supported the Roy-Mullins campaign. However, on July 14, Lord-President Tucker Gladden, the Marquess of Ridgeland, out of the blue, switched sides and crossed the aisle to join the then Hamilton-Bornstein ticket.</p>
<div class="text-center"><div><img class="mx-auto" src="/images/inquiry-ca-2021.png"/></div><p><em>The ruling issued by Associate Justice Jayden Lycon.</em></p></div>
<p>The Lord-President accused the Roy-Mullins campaign of harassment and bribery, which then the Superior Court of the Cupertino Alliance investigated, and they found no wrongdoing in the Roy-Mullins campaign, which then prompted an investigation into the connection between the Lord-President and Daniel Hamilton.</p>
<div class="text-center"><div><img class="mx-auto" src="/images/letter-lycon-2021.png"/></div><p><em>The stern letter made by Associate Justice Lycon.</em></p></div>
<p>Many arguments then ensued between both campaigns over the weekend. AJ Lycon was disappointed and issued a stern letter regarding the elections (which can be read here).</p>
<p>After this, major changes were made, including a liaison and joint planning between both campaigns.</p>
<p>The King and the Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra then issued a joint statement in regards to the degraded relations (which can be read <a href="">here</a>]).</p>

Vishwamitra.</em></p></p></div>
<p>Since then, the relations have been amicable once again, and both the King and Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra continue to commit to more stronger relations.</p></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-gradient-to-tr from-cncRed to-cncGold px-10 py-2 w-screen text-center"><p class="text-white text-sm">Copyright © 2022 CNC, Incorporated.</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"Cupertino Alliance elections causes degradation of Vish-NH relations","date":"2021-07-21T16:25:00.000Z","description":"The upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused...","content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, {})\n  })) : _createMdxContent();\n  function _createMdxContent() {\n    const _components = Object.assign({\n      em: \"em\",\n      p: \"p\",\n      a: \"a\"\n    }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n    return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n      children: [_jsxs(\"div\", {\n        class: \"text-center\",\n        children: [_jsx(\"div\", {\n          children: _jsx(\"img\", {\n            class: \"mx-auto\",\n            src: \"/images/ca-election-jul-2021.png\"\n          })\n        }), _jsx(\"p\", {\n          children: _jsx(_components.em, {\n            children: \"The results of the Cupertino Alliance July 14-17 poll.\"\n          })\n        })]\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"The upcoming Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, currently contested by Daniel Hamilton, Grand Duke of Australis and Dhrubajyoti Roy, Rashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, caused a major strain in relations with the State of Vishwamitra.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(\"div\", {\n        class: \"text-center\",\n        children: [_jsx(\"div\", {\n          children: _jsx(\"img\", {\n            class: \"mx-auto\",\n            src: \"/images/mrt-vish-2021.png\"\n          })\n        }), _jsx(\"p\", {\n          children: _jsx(_components.p, {\n            children: _jsx(_components.em, {\n              children: \"The treaty of mutual recognition signed on June 22, 2021 by His Majesty the\\nRashtradhyaksh of Vishwamitra, His Excellency the Most Honorable Prime\\nMinister Gheorghe Ștefan Marius, and His Majesty the King.\"\n            })\n          })\n        })]\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"Relations with Vishwamitra were established on June 22, 2021, with the signing of a Treaty of Mutual Recognition, which was after months of diplomatic talks with Dhrubajyoti Roy.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"Earlier this year, the April affair caused a temporary halt on diplomatic talks, but was resolved quickly.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"In the Cupertino Alliance chairmanship elections, His Majesty the King originally supported the Roy-Mullins campaign.
