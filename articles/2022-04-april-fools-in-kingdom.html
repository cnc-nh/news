<p>April 1 is Fools&#x27; Day, and Novohierosolymians weren&#x27;t spared from the day&#x27;s wrath. At 10:35AM local time (UTC+8), Lord Dhrubajyoti Roy, Marquess of Lalraja announced the abdication of His Majesty the King, Jayden the First. He also announced the formation of a junta government called the &quot;State Council&quot;, led by him and his deputies, the Duke of Christophus and the Duchess of Bernardus, Lord Paolo vangelista and Lady Dana Abgelina respectively.</p>
<p>The statement read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends,
As you all may know that this is not sudden and was being planned for a long time. In a late night deliberation with HM Jayden I and other officers of the State, it has been decided that he shall abdicate and that in order to replace him in the affairs of the state, a junta government shall be established.
With immediate effect, the powers of the King and Queen shall be removed and they shall be an ordinary citizens of the state. The junta government shall be administered under my leadership as Senior Chairman of the State Council and be assisted by my junior officers including the Duke of Christophus and the Duchess of Bernardus who shall be the Deputy Chair of the State Council.
The State Council further approves the renaming of the nation to &quot;Most Glorious State of Novus Hierosolymis&quot; and that the abdicated King be a prisoner for his abuse of power during his reign. The State Council has also implemented a ban on public speech, human rights and other fundamental rights and violation of the ban could lead to serious punishment and problems. All are asked to be <strong>loyal</strong> to the Council and its members.
Further updates will be provided soon.
Long Live Novus Hierosolymis!
<em>Issued for public interest</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This announcement was met with laughs, because it was quite obvious that it was an April Fools&#x27; prank set up by HM the King and Lord Dhrubajyoti Roy.</p></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-gradient-to-tr from-cncRed to-cncGold px-10 py-2 w-screen text-center"><p class="text-white text-sm">Copyright Â© 2022 CNC, Incorporated.</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"April Fools: King abdicates, nation put under military junta","date":"2022-04-01T14:39:55.351Z","description":"April 1 is Fools' Day, and Novohierosolymians weren't spared from the day's wrath.
