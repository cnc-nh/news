<p>The Rt. Hon. Lord Sander Koff <span class="text-sm">SKBT GCLa MP</span> was elected as Prime Minister today by the House of Commons, after the passage of a motion on his self-nomination. The vote results were as follows:</p>
<table><tr><th>In favor</th>
<th>In opposition</th>
<th>Abstentions</th></tr><tr><td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>2</td></tr></table>
<p>Lord Sander Koff is expected to take charge today, with His Majesty the King also expected to dissolve the provisional absolute government.</p>
<h2>Who is Sander Koff?</h2>
<p>Lord Sander Koff (better known as Sander II) is the King of Revalia, an ally of Novus Hierosolymis. He was also its Prime Minister and Regent until he assumed the Revalian throne. He served as Prime Minister in many nations, including the Republic of Aswington, also an ally of the Kingdom, and as Vice Chancellor under HM the King in the Empire of Oskonia, a former ally. In addition, he formerly served as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Councillors of Vishwamitra.</p>
<p>We reached out to HM the King for comment on the election, and this is what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I congratulate Lord Koff on his election. I believe that he will set a good example for all his successors to follow. He will be a great Prime Minister.</p>
