He was also its Prime Minister and Regent until he assumed the Revalian throne. He served as Prime Minister in many nations, including the Republic of Aswington, also an ally of the Kingdom, and as Vice Chancellor under HM the King in the Empire of Oskonia, a former ally. In addition, he formerly served as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Councillors of Vishwamitra.\n\nWe reached out to HM the King for comment on the election, and this is what he had to say:\n\n\u003e I congratulate Lord Koff on his election. I believe that he will set a good example for all his successors to follow.

In a late night deliberation with HM Jayden I and other officers of the State, it has been decided that he shall abdicate and that in order to replace him in the affairs of the state, a junta government shall be established.\n\u003e With immediate effect, the powers of the King and Queen shall be removed and they shall be an ordinary citizens of the state.

Who are they, what are their platforms, and what should we take note of? We give you our impartial analysis on the candidates and what they are running on.\n\n## David Brooke\n\nDavid Brooke focuses on a community-driven approach to running the MCA: he wants an “equal” community wherein power is shared, not delegated. Main points of his campaign include committees for membership and safety enforcement, monthly changes in the cabinet, and reaching out via Australian regions, among many others. A point of concern is the candidate riding on a community-driven campaign when he himself left the MCA in December of 2021 due to many controversies that surrounded him.\n\n## Rory McPhail\n\nRory McPhail presents himself with his wealth of experience. He is focusing on stringent reforms to the Cabinet and services, increasing member participation within the community through cleanups and community nights, increasing membership via territorial membership and a foray into social media such as Twitter and Instagram, and reviving projects such as the monthly newsletter. McPhail served in many positions in the MCA, most notably as Minister of General Affairs and Membership.\n\n## Kevin Doan\n\nKevin Doan presents himself as a choice against the old rhetoric allegedly shown by Brooke and McPhail: he is focusing on transparent leadership in his run for President by making actions open to the public. At this time Doan has not presented any other public platforms.\n\n## Overall analysis\n\nThe elections for President of the MCA may prove to be one of the most contentious yet. It is a do-or-die election for them: will they be able to elect a leader who will continue the good work the organization has done for the Australian micronational community? Or will they elect a leader who will drag it down?

Albina later admitted to fabricating the falsehood due to a resent of the perceived \"special treatment\" that Kennedy received from the MicroWiki administration, even though she knew that Kennedy herself was banned from the wiki due to a certain distasteful incident, and acted like it was not there to suit her narrative. Kennedy then affirmed her commitment to the cause of the MicroWiki for Justice movement, but said that she \"washes off\" Albina and wishes to not be associated with her any longer.\n\nIn the MicroWiki for Justice server, Albina accused Kennedy of being a liar and manipulator, and hurled many transphobic and fatphobic slurs while Kennedy restated her position numerous times.

On 29 January 2022, Andrew Creed, head administrator of the MicroWiki website, announced the unbanning with this statement:\n\n\u003e User has served his time. Absolutely do not harass this user upon their return to the wiki. Doing so will lead to an immediate ban on the wiki and Discord server.\n\nMicroWiki users were outraged at this decision from the administration, and wrote a joint memorandum condemning this action. As of writing it has amassed over 95 signatures.\n\nThe administration has continually tried to silence members who shared their dismay at the action, with Creed repeatedly ordering MicroWiki@Discord members to cease their discussion on this certain action, and even banning individuals who kept expressing their disgust. Due to these actions, the de facto leaders of the MicroWiki for Justice movement, namely Leon Montan (President of Ponderosa Hills), Sophia Albina (Premier of Nordale), Elizabeth Lewis (Leader of Shoreline), and Cameron Koehler (King of Ikonia and member of the Novohierosolymian Constitutional Committee) created their own Discord server to increase signatories and to make it the replacement for MicroWiki@Discord.\n\nKoehler then proceeded to use backdoors left open via a bot he created when he was a server administrator to ban all persons he could, with 1,996 users removed from the server and leaving only around 40 or so people with Discord roles that were too high to ban. This caused his indefinite ban from MicroWiki and members of the Grand Unified Micronational losing confidence in him as their Supreme Justice.\n\nThe controversy has also spilled into famed statistics company Statistic-Dime founded by the same Zarel Smith, where Creed and Christina Nowell resigned from their posts as members of the Board of Directors, with Liam Alexander, CEO of Statistic-Dime having both \"great shame to see these two tender their resignations\" and satisfaction \"in a sense they will not be here to disturb the peace anymore\". This resulted in the addition of Jayden I as Director.\n\nAs of writing, we at the CNC do not know when this controversy will die down, but we know that this is an unprecedented moment in the history of the MicroWiki sector and is a consequential event. We will continue giving readers of CNC News updates as soon as we have them.\n","slug":"2022-02-microwiki-users-rise-to-condemn"},{"title":"Snyder-Murray wins CA election in a landslide: Valentinus loses for a second time","date":"2022-01-25T07:44:00.000Z","description":"CNC News projects that Carson Snyder and James Murray will be the next Chair and Lieutenant Chair of the Cupertino Alliance, after the 1:30AM EST update from the Cupertino Electoral Supervisory Commission...","socialImage":"/images/ca-election-jan-2022.png","content":"\n\u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cimg class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"/images/ca-election-jan-2022.png\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e_The two candidates for Chair: Snyder and Valentinus._\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n_Jayden I is involved in this election: he is part of the Snyder-Murray campaign team._\n\nUPDATE: Final data from CESE awards 19 votes for Snyder-Murray and 7 votes for Valentinus-Neal.\n\nCNC News projects that Carson Snyder and James Murray will be the next Chair and Lieutenant Chair of the Cupertino Alliance, after the 1:30AM EST update from the Cupertino Electoral Supervisory Commission or CESE gave 17 votes to Snyder-Murray and a mere 6 votes for Valentinus-Neal.\nThis comes after a very quiet campaign season, which is mostly due to the last 2 campaign seasons, which were smeared by constant uncivil discussions among members of the Alliance.\n\nThis is also the first election under the 2021 Charter, which was passed in December.\n\nSnyder ran on a platform focusing on development: some promises their campaign made include an emphasis on development, adoptable and adaptable legislation, and expanding outreach.\n\nValentinus ran on an \"open and accessible\" platform: flipping the status quo on its head and moving back to the 2020 era-Alliance with a plan of reviving the long-dead Windhoek program, as well as focusing on essential services rather than non-sensical and unneeded ones, such as the Statistics Ministry.\n\nA pre-election poll from Statistic-Dime showed that 70% were in support of Snyder, while a measly 30% supported Valentinus.\n\nSnyder and Murray will take office at the end of this month, the final day of Tyler Mullins and Larry Martin's term.\n","slug":"2022-01-snyder-murray-wins-ca-election-in"},{"title":"A new constitution in the works","date":"2022-01-23T06:28:00.000Z","description":"After a long state of inactivity, a glimmer of hope is found in the Constitutional Committee, which begins its work today, drafting the first Novohierosolymian constitution.

Subsequently, he released a statement to the public apologizing for what he did and in doing so, resigned from all micronational offices, including that of Lord-President of the Privy Council, a position created specifically for Lord Gladden by King Jayden I. Lord Gladden was then succeeded by His Grace Lord Paolo Evangelista, the Duke of Christophus.
